    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Updated: 2.1.2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the application Mathronaut, which provides users with game score statistics stored locally on their device. We understand the importance of privacy and want to make it clear that we do not collect, store, or share any personal data about users.</p>

    <h2>2. Collected Data</h2>
    <p>Our App does not collect any personal data or other information from the user. The only data stored by the App relates to game scores, which are saved locally on the user’s device and are visible only to the user within the App.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
    <p>Since the App does not collect or store any personal data, it does not use such data for analytics, marketing, or any other purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Data with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>User data is not shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties, as the App does not collect any data that could be shared.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Although the App does not collect personal data, we aim to ensure that any game score data stored locally remains secure on the user’s device and is not accessible to other applications or third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Since the App does not collect any personal data, users have no need to request access, rectification, or deletion of data. All information remains solely on the user’s device.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at the following email address: <a href="mailto:oj.educationtech@gmail.com">oj.educationtech@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy if necessary. All changes will be posted within the App, and we encourage you to review this page regularly for updates.</p>

    <h2>9. Ads and Third-Party Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App displays ads provided by a third-party advertising partner, such as [e.g., Google AdMob]. These advertising partners may collect data from the user’s device and app usage to deliver personalized ads.</p>

    <p>The collected data may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Location information (if the user has granted permission)</li>
        <li>Other technical data related to the device and app usage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The collection and use of this data are governed by the advertising partner's own privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage users to review the e.g., Google AdMob Privacy Policy for more information about the data practices of our advertising partners.</p>
